# PhoenixBat

### What's PhoenixBat?
It's like coding codingbat, except the instructor can create their own problems.

### How to use?
The program is an executable jar file, which runs in a gui. That file, and all other files, are available in the releases section of this repository. When you open it, it prompts you for two locations on the file system. The problem suite is a .jar file created by the instructor that contains all the problems, and all the test cases for all the problems. The working directory is the directory that contains the student's .class files.

If the student is using BlueJ, they can set the working directory to the BlueJ project's directory.
